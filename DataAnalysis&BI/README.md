# Data Analysis and Business Intelligence Workbook 
Brainstorm for Data Analysis and Business Intelligence Project which includes a Data Streaming Pipeline (Embulk) as well as the use of NoSQL Databases (Apache Cassandra/CouchBase) and Data Processing agents (Apache Spark). Additional Workflow Management will be done using Airflow (https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html).
